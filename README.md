### Arrows
Arrows are a function shorthand using the `=>` syntax.  They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript.  They support both statement block bodies as well as expression bodies which return the value of the expression.  Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical `this` as their surrounding code.
